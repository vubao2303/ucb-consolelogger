### Instructions

* With a partner, spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into a single game of rock paper scissors.

* Try to break it down into steps that you could code out.

* Think of basic elements like loops, if-else statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

* Be prepared to share your outlines approach.


Suggestiona: 

1. Consider what you will need to track through the lifecycle of this game
2. Consider what values need to be generated each 'round'
3. Will you require a four loop? What conditional statements will be required? 
4. Consider outlining your steps

* What do you plan to do
* How do you plan on accomplishing this step
* Why is this step being taken

### Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode

1. Prompt user to enter r, p, or s representing rock, paper, or scissors.

2. Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.

3. We determine if the user wins or not.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

   * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

4. We then add to their score.

   * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
    
   * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
    
   * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

5. Alert the user of their Wins, losses, ties
