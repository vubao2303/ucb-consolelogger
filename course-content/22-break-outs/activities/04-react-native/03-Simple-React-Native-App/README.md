# Simple React Native Application

In this activity, we will build a simple react native application 

## Instructions

- If you haven't done so already, generate a starter app in *00-starter* folder using `expo-cli`. You can do this by running `expo init mobileapp`. We will run all of the activity code today inside of this boilerplate, as to avoid constantly reinstalling the same node modules

- Once you have a mobileapp React Native app generated, delete the `App.js` file inside of your starter app and replace it with the `App.js` provided with this activity.

- Start the app by running `expo start` in your terminal, then navigate to the browser and click on `Run this in browser` option.

- Using the code in the `App.js` file as a starting point, add logic to `clickMe` function

## Hints

- You will need to import one or all elements below:

```
View
Text
StyleSheet
TouchableOpacity
```


- Add the following styles to the View element

```
borderColor: "red",
backgroundColor: "#fff",
borderWidth: 1,
width: 100,
height: 100
```
