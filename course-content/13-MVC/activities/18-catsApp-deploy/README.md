# Deployment

In this activity we will deploy the catsApp application to Heroku with MySQL provisioning.

## Instructions

* To deploy the catsApp application to Heroku make sure to perform the following:

  * Initialize the project folder as a git repo.

  * Create a Heroku app for the catsApp application.

  * Add a MySQL Addon for the catsApp Heroku app.

  * Add and commit your changes before pushing up to Heroku.

### Hints

* If your deployment fails, run `heroku logs` while in the project directory. This should print all of the logs produced from the failed deployment. Usually the issue can be found at the start of any errors.
